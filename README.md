# Twitter-Splash-Animation
Launch App like Twitter bird splash animation.

Developed using:
Xcode 9
Swift 4
iOS target 8.0
Universal

The Code contains the comments required to understand the variables and functions.

Singelton classes are defined to use the code easily. Follow the comments provided in the code, to make easier integration.

There were two motives:
1. Use only splash screen and immediate active the app
OR
2. Use splash screen till any API call finish and then launch the app.

For both usages all the required comments are mentioned in the code. For friendly use haven't used "My Name" to declare any files; So easy to integrate than others.

Three files named:

Splash View: Loads the view
Splash Animation: Extension of Splash View where - Animation Functions are defined here 
Animation Type: Twitter, Zoom Out and Heart beat, three animations defined

Assets: contains the image in place of twitter bird, different image have been used here
